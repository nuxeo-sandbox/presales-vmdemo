## Description

AWS resources to auto update route 53 records when an EC2 instance is restarted/stopped.

# Installation
The installation is not completely automated yet and requires a few manual steps

- Open the AWS console
- Go to the CloudFormation console
- Create a new stack using the template route53-auto-update.template
- Once the stack is created, go to the lambda console
- Open the nuxeo-route53-auto-update function
- Set the runtime to node.js 16x
- Copy paste the content of index.js in the inline editor
- Add an Environment variable HOSTED_ZONE which value is the ID of the target route53 hosted zone (which can be found on the route53 page). It is `Z1Z5JJ6G4B6J7L` for `cloud.nuxeo.com`, but check it is still OK.
- Save
- Go the CloudWatch console
- Open the nuxeo-route53-auto-update rule and enable it
- Back to Lambda, if there is no trigger displayed, create one, bind it to the rule (the drop down helps find your rule)
